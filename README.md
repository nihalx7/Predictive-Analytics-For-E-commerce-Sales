Business Objective
This project aims to empower e-commerce businesses by:

Uncovering sales trends to optimize inventory management.
Segmenting products and customers for targeted marketing.
Forecasting future sales to enhance planning and resource allocation.
Providing actionable insights for stakeholders to drive revenue growth.

Dataset Description
The project uses a historical e-commerce sales dataset with:

Sales transactions (order ID, amount, date)
Product details (category, price)
Customer demographics (age, location)
Purchase timestamps

Note: The dataset is not publicly available due to confidentiality. Contact [Your Email] for access inquiries.
Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: Numerical computations
Seaborn: Statistical visualizations
Matplotlib: Plotting graphs


Database: SQL (data querying and extraction)
Visualization: Tableau (interactive dashboards)
Other: Microsoft Excel (initial data exploration)

Methodology
The project follows a structured workflow:

Data Collection: Acquired historical e-commerce sales data.
Data Exploration: Analyzed data structure and identified missing values using Pandas and Excel.
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected data types, and removed duplicates with SQL and Python.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified trends and patterns using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Feature Engineering: Created features like monthly sales aggregates and customer segments.
Modeling: Built time-series models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) for sales forecasting.
Evaluation: Assessed models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Dashboard Creation: Designed a Tableau dashboard for interactive stakeholder insights.

Key Findings

Sales peak during November and December, likely due to holiday seasons.
Electronics are the top-selling category, followed by clothing.
Millennials represent the largest customer segment, favoring online purchases.
Predictive models achieve approximately 85% accuracy in sales forecasting.

Note: Visualization files (e.g., sales trends, customer segments) are in dashboard/ and reports/ for review.
Future Scope

Integrate real-time data for dynamic forecasting.
Explore deep learning models for improved prediction accuracy.
Add user authentication to the Tableau dashboard for secure access.
Implement A/B testing to evaluate marketing strategies based on predictions.
